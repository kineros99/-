Please create a comprehensive presentation in Portuguese about the "Encarregado" project for
a mixed audience of scholars - some highly technical, others less but all are Portuguese speakers so. The
presentation should be engaging, informative, and use appropriate analogies to
make complex concepts accessible to everyone and written in Portuguese.

================================================================================
PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

PROJECT NAME: Encarregado
TAGLINE: "Intelligent Mapping System for Construction Material Stores in Brazil"

PURPOSE:
A web-based geospatial platform that helps users discover, register, and
navigate construction material stores (lojas de material de construção) across
Brazilian cities, with special focus on Rio de Janeiro initially.

TARGET AUDIENCE:
- Construction professionals seeking suppliers
- Store owners wanting to be discovered
- Urban planners studying commercial distribution
- General public looking for construction materials

CORE PROBLEM SOLVED:
Traditional methods of finding construction stores are fragmented (word of mouth,
outdated directories, scattered Google searches). Encarregado centralizes this
information into an interactive, always-updated map with intelligent search
capabilities.

================================================================================
KEY FEATURES & FUNCTIONALITIES
================================================================================

1. INTERACTIVE MAP VISUALIZATION
   - Real-time display of store locations across Rio de Janeiro
   - Leaflet.js-powered mapping with custom markers
   - Click-to-view store details (name, address, phone, website)
   - Source badges: 🙂 (user-added) vs 🙃 (auto-discovered) vs 🧵 (verified)
   - Smooth navigation and clustering removed for exact positioning

2. INTELLIGENT SEARCH SYSTEM
   - Fuzzy string matching (ignores accents, capitalization, punctuation)
   - Example: "são paulo" = "Sao Paulo" = "SAO PAULO"
   - Real-time filtering by neighborhood, source type, or name
   - Geolocation button for "stores near me" functionality

3. DYNAMIC CITY DISCOVERY
   - Type ANY city name (Fortaleza, São Paulo, Belo Horizonte)
   - System automatically queries Google Maps API
   - Discovers city coordinates and surrounding neighborhoods
   - One-click addition to database - no manual data entry needed
   - Works with 5,570+ Brazilian cities (or worldwide)

4. SCOPED AUTO-POPULATION
   - Admin panel for authorized users (kinEROS authentication)
   - Select specific neighborhoods for targeted store discovery
   - Intelligent limit system based on apuration count:
     * 1st run: 666 stores
     * 2nd run: 123 stores
     * 3rd run: 1000 stores
     * 4th-7th runs: 1000 stores each
     * 8th+ runs: 7 stores (maintenance mode)
   - Real-time cost estimation before execution
   - Duplicate prevention using Google Place IDs

5. USER REGISTRATION SYSTEM
   - Store owners can self-register their businesses
   - Geocoding validation ensures accurate coordinates
   - User-friendly form with address autocomplete suggestions
   - Username-based access for managing listings

6. AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY
   - Admin gate requiring credentials before access
   - Password-protected sensitive operations
   - Separation between public view and admin functions

================================================================================
TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

FRONTEND:
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Leaflet.js for interactive maps
- Font Awesome for icons
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Real-time UI updates without page reloads

BACKEND:
- Netlify Functions (serverless Node.js)
- 10 specialized API endpoints:
  1. get-lojas: Fetch all stores
  2. get-cities: Fetch available cities
  3. get-neighborhoods: Fetch neighborhoods per city
  4. auth-register: User registration
  5. auto-populate-stores: Global store discovery (550 limit)
  6. scoped-auto-populate: Neighborhood-specific discovery
  7. discover-city: Dynamic city addition via Google Maps
  8. discover-neighborhoods: Auto-discover neighborhoods
  9. init_db: Database initialization
  10. seed_lojas: Sample data seeding

DATABASE:
- Neon PostgreSQL (serverless, auto-scaling)
- Key tables:
  * lojas: Store information (name, address, coordinates, source)
  * cities: Brazilian cities with center coordinates
  * neighborhoods: Districts with radius and apuration tracking
  * auto_population_runs: Audit log of API usage
  * store_statistics: Real-time analytics view

THIRD-PARTY APIS:
- Google Maps Geocoding API: Convert addresses to coordinates
- Google Places API (New): Discover nearby stores
- Google Places Text Search: Find neighborhoods

COST OPTIMIZATION:
- Duplicate detection before API calls (prevents redundant requests)
- Intelligent radius-based searching (2-5km zones)
- Apuration limits prevent excessive queries
- Estimated cost: ~$0.032 per API call
- First-run budget: ~$1-2 per city

================================================================================
MAJOR HURDLES SOLVED
================================================================================

1. API KEY RESTRICTIONS (HTTP 403 Errors)
   PROBLEM: Google API was returning "PERMISSION_DENIED" errors
   SOLUTION: Updated API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console to allow
             "Places API (New)" and "Geocoding API"
   ANALOGY: Like having a master key that works on some doors but not others -
            we had to tell the building manager to add more doors to our key.

2. DUPLICATE STORES
   PROBLEM: Re-running searches would add the same stores multiple times
   SOLUTION: Implemented Google Place ID tracking - each store has unique ID
   ANALOGY: Like using Social Security Numbers to identify people - even if
            two stores have same name, their Place ID is always unique.

3. FUZZY STRING MATCHING
   PROBLEM: Users type "Sao Paulo" but database has "São Paulo" (with accent)
   SOLUTION: Unicode normalization (NFD) removes all diacritics before comparing
   ANALOGY: Like teaching the system to ignore font styles when reading text -
            bold, italic, or regular, "hello" is still "hello".

4. DYNAMIC CITY DISCOVERY
   PROBLEM: System only worked with hardcoded Rio de Janeiro neighborhoods
   SOLUTION: Created discover-city and discover-neighborhoods functions that
             query Google Maps API dynamically
   ANALOGY: Instead of having a fixed menu at a restaurant, we gave the chef
            ability to create new dishes on demand based on available ingredients.

5. AUTHENTICATION FLOW
   PROBLEM: Admin tools accessible to anyone
   SOLUTION: Multi-layer authentication with username/password validation
   ANALOGY: Like having a security checkpoint at airport - show ID first,
            then go through scanner, then access the gate.

6. COST MANAGEMENT
   PROBLEM: Google API charges per request - unchecked usage could get expensive
   SOLUTION: Implemented apuration limits, duplicate prevention, and cost preview
   ANALOGY: Like having a spending limit on a credit card - prevents overspending
            while still allowing necessary purchases.

7. REAL-TIME UI UPDATES
   PROBLEM: Users had to refresh page to see new data
   SOLUTION: Async/await JavaScript with loading states and live log updates
   ANALOGY: Like watching a progress bar download files - you see each step
            happening in real-time rather than waiting for completion.

================================================================================
ANALOGY BANK (For Non-Technical Explanations)
================================================================================

DATABASE = FILING CABINET
- Each drawer is a table (lojas, cities, neighborhoods)
- Each folder in a drawer is a row (one store, one city)
- Each label on a folder is a column (name, address, phone)

API = RESTAURANT MENU
- You (client) don't cook the food (backend logic)
- You order from menu (make API request)
- Kitchen (server) prepares and delivers (returns response)
- Some dishes cost more than others (API pricing)

GEOCODING = GPS ADDRESS LOOKUP
- You type human-readable address ("123 Main St")
- System converts to coordinates (latitude/longitude)
- Like phone contacts: "Mom" maps to phone number (555-1234)

SERVERLESS FUNCTIONS = FOOD TRUCK
- Only operates when customers arrive (on-demand)
- Doesn't need permanent building (no dedicated server)
- Cheaper than full restaurant (pay per use)
- Can park anywhere (cloud deployment)

FUZZY MATCHING = AUTOCORRECT
- Ignores typos and variations
- Understands "teh" means "the"
- Our system understands "sao paulo" means "São Paulo"

AUTHENTICATION = AIRPORT SECURITY
- Check ID at first checkpoint (username)
- Verify boarding pass at gate (password)
- Only authorized passengers board plane (access admin panel)

DUPLICATE PREVENTION = LIBRARY BARCODE
- Each book has unique barcode (Place ID)
- Even if two copies of same book, barcode differs
- Scanner knows you're returning the exact same copy you borrowed

SCOPED SEARCH = TARGETED ADVERTISING
- Don't search entire country (too broad/expensive)
- Focus on specific neighborhood (radius-based)
- Get relevant results faster and cheaper

================================================================================
KEY STATISTICS TO MENTION
================================================================================

- Cities supported: Initially 1 (Rio), now unlimited via dynamic discovery
- Neighborhoods in Rio: 27 pre-configured zones
- Store sources: 3 types (user, auto, verified)
- API endpoints: 10 specialized functions
- Search radius: 2-5km depending on area density
- Max stores per neighborhood: 666 (first run) to 7 (maintenance runs)
- Cost per city discovery: ~$0.05 (one-time)
- Cost per neighborhood apuration: ~$0.032 per API call
- Database technology: PostgreSQL (serverless)
- Frontend map library: Leaflet.js (open source)
- Deployment: Netlify (global CDN)

================================================================================
